# Gelatin Microfluidics
## Introduction

Due to the required high proximity of cells to blood vessels the fabrication of vascular structures has enormous impact on the engineering of tissues and organs. However, the required resolution and structural integrity is yet to be reached, thus, the fabrication of thick vascular tissues is still the main challenge to solve in tissue engineering.
This protocol is a modification of the freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) method for the fabrication of freeform perfusable microfluidics inside a gelatine matrix, which can be used in the construction of vascular grafts, for the purposes of tissue and organ engineering.
The FRESH method for the preparation of the gelatine matrix, which allows precise deposition of material inside a gelatin matrix, and consequently the fabrication of almost any shape or form, has been adapted after Hinton et al. 2015. The method was already shown to produce vascular tissues, our adaptation however, gives higher control over the resolution of the matrix and consequently allows for the fabrication of thinner vessels (internal diameter as low as 210Î¼m).
